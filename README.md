I’ve been working on GenAI-based systems in production at massive scale over the past two years, and I thought it’s time to give back to the community.

So, I’ve started building a hands-on repo to share what I’ve learned — the concepts behind AI-powered systems, in a way that’s practical and easy to follow.

Each lesson includes fully-functional, self-explanatory code — no fluff, just what matters.

𝘛𝘶𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘭𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘰𝘴 will follow to turn each sample into a complete learning experience.

𝗠𝘆 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵:

𝗕𝗙𝗦-𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: I start simple and build depth gradually to avoid overwhelming jumps in complexity.

𝗖𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀-𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: While most GenAI resources are Python-heavy, I start with other languages such as TypeScript (when possible) and later add Python equivalents.

𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Focus on core ideas, skipping unnecessary abstraction and tooling.

The repo currently focuses on 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 and 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 in 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁.

You can use the Issues section to ask questions or request new lessons.

I won’t wait for each course (code, tutorial, video) to be complete before publishing — so if you're interested, keep checking back.

Happy Coding!
